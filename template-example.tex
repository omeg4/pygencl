\opening{To whom it may concern,}

  My name is John Smith and I am excited to apply to \company for the role of \job.
  I believe that I would be a good fit for this job because of my prior work experience, skillset, and personality.

  In short, my passion for this role is driven by a ``love of the game''.
  I love doing my job, which is why I do it, and why I am good at it.
  Because I am good at what I do, I can distinguish myself from other candidates by pointing out a specific accomplishment of which I am proud.
  If you hire me, I can do that thing for your company, too.

  Thank you for your consideration of my application for this position.
  I look forward to hearing back about the next steps in the application process and I would be more than happy to further discuss my qualifications and fit for the role.


\closing{Sincerely yours,}
